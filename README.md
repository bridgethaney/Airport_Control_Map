#### How to use the map

On the interactive Leaftlet map, which is accessible from https://bridgethaney.github.io/Airport_Control_Map/, there are two kinds of airports that are displayed. The red plane symbol represents airports with control towers. The blue airplane symbol represents airports without control towers. When clicking on the airport markers, the name of the selected airport is shown through a popup. This allows users to specifically find out which airports do or do not have control towers. Along with this, there is noticeable ruler icon to the right of the map directly below the legend. This is an added ruler plug-in, which was created by Göker Tanrısever, that allows for distance measurements between selected points. Click on the ruler icon and then place a point anywhere on the map. From there, drag anywhere to see the distance in km. To exit out of this feature, double tap the escape button and the ruler will close.

##### Analysis

I was surprised to see several hundred airports without a control tower. This is seemingly hazardous, as there is not proper focus being placed on air traffic. It is especially apparent in Alaska how many airports exist without control towers.
